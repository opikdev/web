Welcome to my blog.

I write about web development, AI integration, and building better web applications. I focus on practical insights, not hype. What actually works, what matters, and how to make good decisions when building software.

You'll find posts about modern web development and architecture, AI integration and LLM-powered features, AI technologies and tools, design and user experience, and the kind of technical judgment that leads to better outcomes.

Thanks for reading.
