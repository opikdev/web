		<p>
			I'm a software engineer who enjoys building clean, modern web applications and experimenting with AI in a practical way. 
			My current interest is LLM integration and AI tools, not as hype, but as building blocks for better web products.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe AI is leverage. It will change how we build web applications and how businesses operate. 
			What matters to me is using it with good judgment: knowing what should be automated, what should stay human, 
			and what is actually worth shipping.
		</p>

		<p>
			I like working at the intersection of technical and non-technical decisions. A strong solution is not only correct in code. 
			It is also clear in scope, sensible in tradeoffs, and aligned with the problem and the people it affects.
		</p>

		<ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6 space-y-2.5">
			<li><strong class="text-zinc-50">Frontend:</strong> React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt, Astro, Tailwind CSS</li>
			<li><strong class="text-zinc-50">Backend & Full-stack:</strong> TypeScript, Node.js, REST APIs, Supabase, Prisma, WebSockets</li>
			<li><strong class="text-zinc-50">AI Integration:</strong> LLM APIs, AI tools, prompt engineering</li>
			<li><strong class="text-zinc-50">Architecture & Design:</strong> system architecture, UI/UX design, technical standards</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p class="pt-4">
			Beyond the tools, I care about clarity. Good web applications come from solid architecture, good design taste, 
			and the ability to make critical calls when the answer is not obvious.
